                        <p>I laughed, I cried, I loved this book. It was an emotional rollercoaster filled with battles contrasted by heartfelt moments. It covered themes of friendship and family and the characters have changed and grown so much that you can't help but love them and care about their story and what happens next. I'm honestly terrified to see what happens in the next book but I am also really excited to see whats next for these characters.</p>

                        <h2>Short Story</h2>
                        <h3>Things I Wish Never Happened</h3>
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>The doorbell rings. Mum is in the kitchen cooking and dads at work, so I walk downstairs and answer it. It’s aunt June.
                            ‘Hi Mason, I know I’m early, but I thought I could help set up.’ 
                            ‘Sure, come in. Mums in the kitchen.’ I reply.
                        She steps inside and I close the door. I go back upstairs avoiding looking to my left as I walk to my bedroom door. I go in, close the door, and lie on my bed. Dad will be home soon, and more people will arrive, and I’ll have to socialise. I put in my headphones to drown out the thought. 
                        Mum walks into my room. She must’ve knocked and I didn’t hear. I take off my headphones.</p> 
                        <p>‘I knocked.’ She says. 
                            ‘It’s okay, mum.’
                        She nods, then continues. 
                        ‘Everything is ready, and people are starting to arrive, could you please come downstairs.’ </p>
                        <p>‘Sure, I’ll be there in a sec.’ 
                        She leaves closing the door behind her. I change my t-shirt to a white button-up and head downstairs. There’s already a small crowd of people surrounding a table in the middle of the living room and as they part for me, I see her photo surrounded by a ton of flowers on either side. It’s been a year and I’m still in disbelief. My sister, Maddy, is gone. Some asshole raped and murdered her and left her in a field miles away. And even though he’s in jail for life and it’s been a year I can’t believe it. She would have been 16. Everyone’s here to remember her, everyone except dad whose late, again. He took it hardest and hasn’t been the same since. He can’t even look at me. I hate that. He says it’s because I look too much like her. We were twins. And now I’ll always be one half of a whole because of some stupid paedophile. A reminder of what my parents have lost.</p>   
                        <p>‘How are you doing son?’ my uncle Jack asks.
                            ‘I’m okay.’
                            ‘I’m so sorry boy. I know it’s been a year, but the pain never really goes away, does it?’ 
                        I nod my head in agreement because he’s right. My chest still hurts every time I think about her, or someone mentions her name, or I see a photo of her. That’s why I can’t even look in the direction of her bedroom because I’d wanna go inside, expecting to find her there, and would be hit with an overwhelming sense of grief when I didn’t.</p> 
                        <p>My dad finally walks in and walks straight past me. I should be used to it by now but I’m not and this time something in me snaps. I walk up to him and grab his face. 
                            ‘Look at me.’ 
                        He resists.
                            ‘I said look at me god damm it!’
                        He stops resisting and his eyes trace my face finally landing on my eyes. His eyes begin to well as a tear falls from mine. It’s the first time I’ve cried since it happened. I thought I had to be strong for my parents. But right now, looking into my dad’s eyes, seeing the same pain I feel, I break. I hug my dad.
                        ‘I miss her too dad. Every day I wish it never happened. That she was still here. But it did, and she isn’t and that’s something we have to deal with. You may have lost a daughter, but I lost half of me. The least you could do is look at the child that’s still here.’
                        My dad squeezes me tighter then looks at me again and I can tell he no longer sees Maddy. He finally sees me, Mason.
